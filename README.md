<p align="center">Converter for TBX-files to HTML</p>
</pre>

## Übersicht / Overview
**TBX to HTML** converts TBX files into readable HTML files. It analyzes the TBX file and allows you to select the desired columns for conversion.

## Installation
No installation is required. Simply use the **tbx_to_html.exe** file from the "MVP" folder to start the tool.

## Usage
1. open the program:
       Open the "TBX to HTML" program.
2. select a TBX file:

<img src="MVP/img/Programm%20öffnet%20sich.PNG" width="250">

- Click on the "Select file" button. (1)
- Select the desired TBX file from your file system and confirm the selection with "Open".

3. column selection:

- After selecting the file, a window opens to select the columns to be displayed in the HTML document.
- You can select the columns by activating the corresponding checkboxes.
- Alternatively, you can also use the "Select all" option to select all available columns at once (recommended).
- Click on "Next" to continue.

4. conversion:

- After the column selection, the TBX file is converted into an HTML document.
- After successful conversion, the HTML is saved in the same directory as the original TBX file. The file is called "terminology_YYYY-MM-DD", whereby the current day is taken as the date.

5. close the program:
       Once the conversion is complete, you can close the program by clicking on the "Close program" button (2).
